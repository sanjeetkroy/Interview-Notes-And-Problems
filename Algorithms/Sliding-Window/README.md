# Sliding window
The Sliding window is a problem-solving technique of data structure and algorithm for problems that apply arrays or lists. These problems are painless to solve using a brute force approach in O(n²) or O(n³). However, the Sliding window technique can reduce the time complexity to O(n).

The basic idea behind the sliding window technique is to transform two nested loops into a single loop.

__Below are some fundamental clues to identify such kind of problem__:

- The problem will be based on an array, list or string type of data structure.
- It will ask to find subrange in that array or string will have to give longest, shortest, or target values.
- Its concept is mainly based on ideas like the longest sequence or shortest sequence of something that satisfies a given condition perfectly.
